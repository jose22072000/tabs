# Tabs Component

A simple tabs component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to switch between different content sections.

## Features

- Four tabs with different content
- First tab active by default
- Smooth transitions between tabs
- Responsive design

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: 
   - Tab headers are created as clickable elements
   - Tab content is organized in separate div elements
   - Each tab header is linked to its content via data attributes

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Tabs are styled with a clean, modern look
   - Active tab is highlighted with a bottom border
   - Content panes are hidden by default
   - Only the active content pane is displayed
   - Smooth fade-in animation when switching tabs

3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Event listeners are added to each tab header
   - When a tab is clicked, all tabs and content panes are reset
   - The clicked tab and its corresponding content are made active

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Event handling (click events)
- CSS transitions and animations
- Dynamic content display
- Data attributes for element association

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the tabs in action. Click on different tab headers to switch between content sections.
